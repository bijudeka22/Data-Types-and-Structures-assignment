This means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. This characteristic provides several benefits:\n","- Data Consistency: Immutability guarantees that the data within a tuple remains constant throughout its lifecycle. This prevents accidental or intentional modifications that could compromise the integrity of the data.\n","- Security: Since tuples cannot be altered, they provide a level of security by protecting data from unauthorized changes. This is particularly important when dealing with sensitive information.\n","- Hashing and Indexing: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries because they are immutable and hashable. This allows for efficient data retrieval and indexing.\n","- Readability: The immutability of tuples can improve code readability by making it clear that certain data should not be modified. This can help prevent unexpected behavior and make code easier to maintain.\n","By utilizing tuples when appropriate, Python developers can enhance the reliability and security of their code and ensure that data remains accurate and consistent."],"metadata":{"id":"HFvvPQCQ2-lP"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["8.What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n","- A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs in an array format, with each data value having a unique index value. The hash value of the key determines the correct bucket to store the data\n","- In Python, the Dictionary data type is the implementation of hash tables. The keys in a Python dictionary are hashable, meaning they are generated by a hash function that produces a unique result for each value"],"metadata":{"id":"tcvK8B1g8PxH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9.Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n","- list can also contain a mix of Python types including strings, floats, and booleans."],"metadata":{"id":"Jei1bvlB3a87"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["10.Explain why strings are immutable in python?\n","- strings are immutable because they cannot be changed after they are created."],"metadata":{"id":"dbqbbjpm5PjE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["11.What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n","\n","- Dictionaries offer several advantages over lists for certain tasks, including:\n","- Quick lookups: Dictionaries are ideal for quick lookups, such as mapping usernames to user data.\n","-Easier to read: Dictionaries make code easier to read when generating key:value pairs.\n","-More flexible data storage: Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs, which offers more flexibility than lists.\n","-Faster lookup operations: Dictionaries are faster than lists for lookup operations."],"metadata":{"id":"20TD6WGy6h2C"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n","- Use a tuple if you need an immutable collection where the elements won't change after creation.

Due to this, set items cannot be referred to by key or index."],"metadata":{"id":"HWb3Pejy8eQ3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["14.How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?"],"metadata":{"id":"OYf6sGVp9U7j"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["15.Can you modify the elements of a tuple?

This means the position of each element within the list is fixed.Accessed by Index: You access elements in a list using their numerical index (starting from 0).\n","     For example, to access the first item in a list named my_list, you use my_list[0].\n","- Dictionaries:\n","   Unordered Collection: Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs.\n","   Accessed by Keys: You access values in a dictionary using their associated keys.\n","For example, if a dictionary named my_dict has a key \"name\" with the value \"Alice\", you access the value using my_dict[\"name\"].\n","In Summary:\n"," *
